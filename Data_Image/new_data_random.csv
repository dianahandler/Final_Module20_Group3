814 Theresa Ave,78703,"You'll feel the character and romance of this charming 1-story bungalow in desirable historic Clarksville as soon as you arrive at this property. Minutes from Downtown Austin, this 1925 craftsman-style home has 3 bedrooms and 2 baths. Unlike most historic homes, recent renovations have opened up the floor plan so that the living room with wood-burning fireplace, dining room, and kitchen flow together as one space. Upon entering, you'll fall in love with the antique pine floors that add warmth and character to the room. You will also appreciate the large windows that fill each area with light and highlight the magnificent original built-ins that line the fireplace wall. Regardless of the season, there is nothing like sitting beside a fire with softly flickering flames and the sound of crackling wood. What better place to end your day than in a cozy leather chair in this meticulously cared for home? This home feels larger than its footprint. Imagine entertaining in your gorgeous gourmet kitchen. As your guests sip wine, you can socialize as you wash veggies fresh from the market in your farmhouse sink. Then, serve your guests at the table as they are drawn into the dining area by the smell of a sumptuous meal and the clatter of dishes. After dinner, your guests will flow back into the living room for after dinner drinks and stimulating conversation. Then, when you retire for the night in your master bedroom, you can open the French doors to the back deck where you can relax and enjoy the privacy of your fenced yard. Grab a glass of wine and turn up the music as you enter your spa-like bath with marble tile floors, marble counters, and frameless glass shower. Or, a soak in your elegant claw-foot tub might be even more relaxing. If your guests stay over, there are two rooms that are suitable as bedrooms or a home office. In the morning, step off the raised rear deck onto beautiful, maintenance-free turf that is so much like grass you won't believe your eyes. It is perfect for lawn games or pets throughout the year. You'll love exploring this neighborhood. Walk down the street and find the trailhead to Lady Bird Lake or around the corner to Clarksville Park and Splash Pad. With Austin ISD's highly-rated Matthews Elementary less than a half mile away, this is a good choice for those with elementary-age students at home. You'll also love meeting neighbors at social activities at Clarkesville Park at events like Summer outdoor movies and ice cream socials at the community center. Your busy life will become easier now that you can bike to big events like SXSW at Zilker Metropolitan Park and pick up groceries at Fresh Plus, Whole Foods, or Trader Joes. Clarksville is part of Old West Austin and just minutes from the heart of Downtown Austin. One option is to leave your car parked and bike into the city. Clarksville is known for having an authentic Austin vibe. The city also protects and celebrates its earliest history. While new homes may go under construction, they must meet the guidelines of the Clarksville Historic District. This home brings with it the best of old and new. Capturing the simplicity and quality of construction of the era, your home joins other remarkable properties in this lovely, shaded setting. For a vintage property, 814 Theresa Avenue is among the best on the market. ",30.28076744,-97.76563263,1,0,1,0,330000,6098,1478,2,3,1,223
